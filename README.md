<div style="text-align:center">Warning: This is *not* a good example of a library.</div>

Since a long time ago, I've really wanted to make a discord library.
And I've tried before, only to fail at the numerous data models discord
has. So this time, I told myself: "This is it. I'm going to do this."
You see, it was almost my birthday, and what a birthday present this is.

I actually made this.

Sure it's terrible, it's got terrible implementations all around, but
I learned about what I want to improve for the next try I have.

So yeah, enjoy the terrible code, and hopefully find better ways to do
it yourself. If you do, please tell me? I'm going to make another attempt,
one which isn't going to die at the late to end stages, one that is better
designed, so just hang around there.

I'm @A5rocks#9289 on discord by the way. See the examples folder for examples.
